ABOUT ME (*1998-*)
========================

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient systems. Currently based in Argentina 🇦🇷.

Curious by nature, guided by strong beliefs but grounded in pragmatism. I'm usually quiet, though not actually reserved: happy to disclose all my secrets to any gossipy ears when requested.
Nothing matters more to me than my loved ones: for my closest friends, I'd do anything.

I believe in Aristotle's idea of virtue. I'm always chasing a better version of myself, not through hacks or shortcuts but by the quiet rhythm of effort, reflection and becoming.
I do not believe in panaceas. The path to improvement is rarely simple and never one-size-fits-all.
